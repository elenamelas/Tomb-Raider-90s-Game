                <p>My advice is to keep chipping away at the boss by shooting him in his vulnerable back whenever you can. When he's taken a few more hits, he will again sink to one knee, and you'll see the Melee icon above him. Quickly move in close and press Melee.</p>

                <p>Kill it, pick up the health pack and continue forward into the alcove from which the wolf emerged. Use the switch there to open the exit doors. Leave the switch room, turn right and go through the first opening overlooking the exit. Hop down, slide to the ground and go through the big doors to end the level.</p>
